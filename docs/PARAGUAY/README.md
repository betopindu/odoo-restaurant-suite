## Overview

The Paraguay implementation lives in the country-specific addon `einvoice_py`.

The addon keeps Paraguay fiscal concepts outside the country-neutral core while using the shared fiscal document lifecycle, tenant isolation, attachments, events, and adapter pattern.

Current implemented Paraguay stages:

* issuer configuration
* establishment configuration
* point of issue configuration
* timbrado configuration
* CSC configuration
* sequence configuration
* numbering
* CDC generation
* normalized payload builder
* fiscal data enrichment for receiver, operation, payment, and tax details
* administrative UI stabilization for validation/support workflows

## Configuration

### Issuer

`fiscal.py.issuer` stores Paraguay issuer fiscal data needed for future SIFEN processing and CDC generation.

Key data:

* RUC without DV
* RUC DV
* taxpayer type
* tenant
* company
* environment

Issuer data is snapshotted onto the fiscal document during Paraguay processing so historical documents remain stable if configuration changes later.

### Establishment

`fiscal.py.establishment` represents the Paraguay establishment code.

An active establishment belongs to an issuer and carries tenant/company scope.

### Point Of Issue

`fiscal.py.point.of.issue` represents the Paraguay point of issue, also known as punto de expedicion.

It belongs to an establishment and provides the three-digit point code used in the full document number and CDC.

### Timbrado

`fiscal.py.timbrado` represents Paraguay fiscal authorization.

It is scoped by tenant, company, environment, and document type, and can be associated with allowed points of issue.

### CSC

`fiscal.py.csc` stores IdCSC and CSC configuration for Paraguay.

CSC is not used for CDC generation. It is reserved for future QR/hash generation.

The CSC value is sensitive and should not be exposed in APIs or public payloads.

See [ADR-009 CSC Only For QR](../ADR/ADR-009-csc-only-for-qr.md).

### Sequence

`fiscal.py.sequence` stores Paraguay numbering configuration.

Sequences are scoped by:

* tenant
* company
* timbrado
* establishment
* point of issue
* document type

The initial next number is configured manually to support migration from existing numbering.

## Numbering

Paraguay numbering runs before CDC generation.

The assigned fields are:

* `py_document_number`
* `py_full_number`

`py_full_number` format:

```text
EST-PUNEXP-NUMBER
```

Example:

```text
001-003-0000015
```

Retries do not assign a new number when one already exists.

See [ADR-008 Paraguay Numbering Before CDC](../ADR/ADR-008-paraguay-numbering-before-cdc.md).

## CDC

CDC generation happens after issuer/config selection and numbering.

The CDC is stored in:

* `py_cdc`
* `py_cdc_base`
* `py_cdc_dv`
* `py_cod_seg`
* core `country_identifier`

The core remains country-neutral by using `country_identifier` as the shared fiscal identifier field.

See [ADR-002 CDC as Country Identifier](../ADR/ADR-002-cdc-country-identifier.md).

## Payload

`PyPayloadBuilder` builds a normalized Paraguay payload dictionary before XML generation.

The payload includes:

* document
* operation
* issuer
* receiver
* condition
* items
* totals
* paraguay
* warnings

The payload is persisted as a sensitive fiscal attachment of type `paraguay_payload_json`.

See [ADR-003 Payload Before XML](../ADR/ADR-003-payload-before-xml.md).

## Fiscal Data Enrichment

Stage 5.5 enriches the Paraguay payload data model with explicit fiscal fields on documents and document lines.

Document-level enrichment includes:

* receiver nature and operation type
* receiver country, address, and phone
* transaction type
* tax type
* currency and exchange rate
* sale condition
* payment type, amount, and currency

Line-level enrichment includes:

* internal item code
* unit measure code and description
* tax affectation
* tax rate
* tax proportion
* tax base
* tax amount
* exempt base
* discount amount

The payload builder uses these explicit fields to reduce warnings and calculate MVP tax buckets for exempt, IVA 5, and IVA 10 lines.

XML remains a future stage.

## Stage 5 Validation

The Fiscal Document form is an administrative and support tool. It is used for troubleshooting, audit, payload validation, and controlled correction flows. It is not intended to become the primary manual invoice-entry interface.

Primary operational channels remain:

* POS
* ERP integrations
* SaaS API
* future country or customer-specific integrations

Administrative users can validate a standard Paraguay invoice with:

* document type: invoice
* local taxpayer receiver
* receiver RUC with DV
* receiver address and email
* transaction type: service provision
* tax type: IVA
* sale condition: cash
* payment type: cash
* currency: PYG
* one line taxed by IVA 10%
* line tax base and tax amount populated

Expected result:

* Paraguay number assigned
* CDC assigned and copied to `country_identifier`
* Paraguay payload attachment generated
* IVA 10 bucket populated
* payload warnings empty for the fully populated MVP scenario

Warnings remain meaningful when optional or required-for-fiscal-quality data is missing, such as receiver DV, receiver email/address, receiver fiscal nature, operation type, or item tax details.

## Future XML

XML generation is not implemented yet.

The expected future direction is to transform the normalized Paraguay payload into SIFEN XML.

## Future QR

QR generation is not implemented yet.

Future QR generation should use IdCSC and CSC hash rules. CSC must not be used for CDC generation.

See [ADR-009 CSC Only For QR](../ADR/ADR-009-csc-only-for-qr.md).

## Future SIFEN

SIFEN submission is not implemented yet.

Future SIFEN work should build on:

* normalized Paraguay payload
* XML generation
* digital signature
* QR generation
* authority response normalization
* retry/error handling
