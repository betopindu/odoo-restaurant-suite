## Overview

The Paraguay implementation lives in the country-specific addon `einvoice_py`.

The addon keeps Paraguay fiscal concepts outside the country-neutral core while using the shared fiscal document lifecycle, tenant isolation, attachments, events, and adapter pattern.

Current implemented Paraguay stages:

* issuer configuration
* establishment configuration
* point of issue configuration
* timbrado configuration
* CSC configuration
* sequence configuration
* numbering
* CDC generation
* normalized payload builder

## Configuration

### Issuer

`fiscal.py.issuer` stores Paraguay issuer fiscal data needed for future SIFEN processing and CDC generation.

Key data:

* RUC without DV
* RUC DV
* taxpayer type
* tenant
* company
* environment

Issuer data is snapshotted onto the fiscal document during Paraguay processing so historical documents remain stable if configuration changes later.

### Establishment

`fiscal.py.establishment` represents the Paraguay establishment code.

An active establishment belongs to an issuer and carries tenant/company scope.

### Point Of Issue

`fiscal.py.point.of.issue` represents the Paraguay point of issue, also known as punto de expedicion.

It belongs to an establishment and provides the three-digit point code used in the full document number and CDC.

### Timbrado

`fiscal.py.timbrado` represents Paraguay fiscal authorization.

It is scoped by tenant, company, environment, and document type, and can be associated with allowed points of issue.

### CSC

`fiscal.py.csc` stores IdCSC and CSC configuration for Paraguay.

CSC is not used for CDC generation. It is reserved for future QR/hash generation.

The CSC value is sensitive and should not be exposed in APIs or public payloads.

See [ADR-009 CSC Only For QR](../ADR/ADR-009-csc-only-for-qr.md).

### Sequence

`fiscal.py.sequence` stores Paraguay numbering configuration.

Sequences are scoped by:

* tenant
* company
* timbrado
* establishment
* point of issue
* document type

The initial next number is configured manually to support migration from existing numbering.

## Numbering

Paraguay numbering runs before CDC generation.

The assigned fields are:

* `py_document_number`
* `py_full_number`

`py_full_number` format:

```text
EST-PUNEXP-NUMBER
```

Example:

```text
001-003-0000015
```

Retries do not assign a new number when one already exists.

See [ADR-008 Paraguay Numbering Before CDC](../ADR/ADR-008-paraguay-numbering-before-cdc.md).

## CDC

CDC generation happens after issuer/config selection and numbering.

The CDC is stored in:

* `py_cdc`
* `py_cdc_base`
* `py_cdc_dv`
* `py_cod_seg`
* core `country_identifier`

The core remains country-neutral by using `country_identifier` as the shared fiscal identifier field.

See [ADR-002 CDC as Country Identifier](../ADR/ADR-002-cdc-country-identifier.md).

## Payload

`PyPayloadBuilder` builds a normalized Paraguay payload dictionary before XML generation.

The payload includes:

* document
* operation
* issuer
* receiver
* condition
* items
* totals
* paraguay
* warnings

The payload is persisted as a sensitive fiscal attachment of type `paraguay_payload_json`.

See [ADR-003 Payload Before XML](../ADR/ADR-003-payload-before-xml.md).

## Future XML

XML generation is not implemented yet.

The expected future direction is to transform the normalized Paraguay payload into SIFEN XML.

## Future QR

QR generation is not implemented yet.

Future QR generation should use IdCSC and CSC hash rules. CSC must not be used for CDC generation.

See [ADR-009 CSC Only For QR](../ADR/ADR-009-csc-only-for-qr.md).

## Future SIFEN

SIFEN submission is not implemented yet.

Future SIFEN work should build on:

* normalized Paraguay payload
* XML generation
* digital signature
* QR generation
* authority response normalization
* retry/error handling
